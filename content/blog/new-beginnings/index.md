WordPress (WP, WordPress.org) is a free and open-source content management system
[(CMS)] written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. Features include
a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes.
WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system but has evolved to
support other web content types including more traditional mailing lists and forums,
media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems [(LMS)] and online 
stores. WordPress is used by more than 40.5% of the top 10 million websites as of 
March 2021, WordPress is one of the most popular content management system solutions
in use.WordPress has also been used for other application domains, such as pervasive 
display systems [(PDS)]

## Multi-user and multi-blogging

Prior to version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple
concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate 
database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, 
WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to 
exist within one installation but is able to be administered by a centralized maintainer. 
WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, 
as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MS 
adds eight new data tables for each blog.

- As of the release of WordPress 3, WordPress MU has merged with WordPress.

WordPress also features integrated link management; a search engine–friendly, clean 
permalink structure; the ability to assign multiple categories to posts; and support 
for tagging of posts. Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized 
formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to 
smart quotes). WordPress also supports the Trackback and Pingback standards for displaying
links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. WordPress posts 
can be edited in HTML, using the visual editor, or using one of a number of plugins 
that allow for a variety of customized editing features.

### WordPress 5.0 "Bebo"

It included a new default editor [Gutenberg] – a block-based editor; it allows users
to modify their displayed content in a much more user friendly way than prior iterations. 
Blocks are abstract units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout 
of a web page. Past content that was created on WordPress pages is listed under what is 
referred to as a Classic Block. Prior to Gutenberg, there were several block-based 
editors available as WordPress plugins, e.g. Elementor, and following the release of 
Gutenberg Elementor was compared to existing plugins.

> The Classic Editor Plugin was created as a result of User preferences
>  and helped website developers maintain past plugins only compatible with [WordPress] [4.9.8], 
   giving plugin developers time to get their plugins updated & compatible with the [5.0] release.
> Having the Classic Editor plugin installed restores the "classic" editing experience that 
  WordPress has had up until the WordPress 5.0 release. 

 The Classic Editor Plugin will be supported at least until 2022.

The Classic Editor plugin is active on over 5,000,000 installations of WordPress

Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little were co-founders of the project. The core lead develope
include Helen Hou-Sandí, Dion Hulse, Mark Jaquith, Matt Mullenweg, Andrew Ozz, a
Andrew Nacin.WordPress is also developed by its community, including WP testers, a 
group of volunteers who test each release. They have early access to nightly builds, 
beta versions and release candidates. Errors are documented in a special mailing list 
or the project's Trac tool.

Though largely developed by the community surrounding it, WordPress is closely associated 
with Automattic, the company founded by Matt Mullenweg.[119] On September 9, 2010, Automattic 
handed the WordPress trademark to the newly created WordPress Foundation, which is an umbrella 
organization supporting WordPress.org (including the software and archives for plugins and themes), 
bbPress and BuddyPress.

#### WordCamp developer and user conferences

WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences covering everything related 
to WordPress. The first such event was WordCamp 2006 in August 2006 in San 
Francisco, which lasted one day and had over 500 attendees. The first 
WordCamp outside San Francisco was held in Beijing in September 2007. Since 
then, there have been over 1,022 WordCamps in over 75 cities in 65 different countries
around the world. WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was the last official annual 
conference of WordPress developers and users taking place in San Francisco, having 
now been replaced with WordCamp US. First ran in 2013 as WordCamp Europe, 
regional WordCamps in other geographical regions are held with the aim of connecting 
people who aren't already active in their local communities and inspire attendees 
to start user communities in their hometowns. In 2019, the Nordic region had 
its own WordCamp Nordic. The first WordCamp Asia was to be held in 2020, 
but cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

##### Wherever far wow thus a squirrel raccoon jeez jaguar this from along

WordPress' plugin architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality
of a website or blog. As of January 2021, WordPress.org has 58,164 plugins available,
each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their 
sites to their specific needs. However, this does not include the premium plugins 
that are available (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed in the WordPress.org 
repository. These customizations range from search engine optimization (SEO), to client 
portals used to display private information to logged-in users, to content management 
systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of widgets and navigation 
bars. Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades, and as a result, 
they may not function properly or may not function at all. Most plugins are available 
through WordPress themselves, either via downloading them and installing the files 
manually via FTP or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer 
plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.

Web developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists 
of over 300 hooks divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks
